<summary><b>2. Do I still need to take the course if I am currently working?</b></summary>
<p>A. Yes, you do. Even if you are currently working or have worked in the past, you will still need to take the Internship Experience course as a degree requirement.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>3. I did an internship last summer. Can I use that to cover the requirements for the course?</b></summary>
<p>A. Unfortunately, you can not use a past internship job to fulfill the course requirements. You must hold your internship position and work the required number of hours WHILE you are registered in the Internship Experience course.
</p>
</details>


<details>
<summary><b>4. I have signed up for the course for the coming semester. Is there a deadline to secure an internship position? </b></summary>
<p>A. Yes, you do. You need secure an internship position AND to complete all required paperwork through Handshake by the end of the second Friday of the semester. You will be removed from the Internship Experience course automatically after this deadline.
</p>
</details>


<details>

<details>
<summary><b>6.Besiding working at my internship, do I need to do anything else for this course?</b></summary>
<p>A. Yes, you have to complete the following requirements in order to earn the credit.
  <ul>
  <li>Attend every scheduled class meetings</li>
  <li>Submit weekly logs</li>
  <li>Complete a final internship report</li>
  <li>Give progress presentations during the class</li>
  </ul>

  Please check the specific course syllabus for meeting dates and other details.
</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>7. Do I need to write weekly logs every week? How many hours do I need to log?</b></summary>
<p>A. Weekly logs are due on Sunday at 11:59 pm of every week you worked at your internship until you complete the hours at your internship necessary for gaining the required credit hours.
</p>
<p>
One credit hour is roughly equally to 40 hours of internship work. For example, if you are enrolled in 3 credit hours of Internship Experience class then you have to complete 120 hours of internship.  You don't have to submit more weekly logs after you reach the total hours required based on your registered credits. Also, you don't need to submit any logs for the weeks you have not worked. </p>
</details>


<details>
<summary><b>8. Can I start my internship position before the Internship Experience course starts?</b></summary>
<p>A> Yes. You may start your internship before the course starts, but you can count only up to 20% of the hours toward the total internship hours required, providing that you will complete the remaining hours during the same semester.
</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>9.What do I need to request CPT Authorization with my internship?</b></summary>
<p>
A. To request CPT Authorization you will need the following items:
    <ul>
    <li>internship job description or job posting</li>
    <li>internship offer letter</li>
    <li>proof of your course registration (a screen shot of your registration in the Internship course will suffice as long as your name or UNH student ID number is visible)</li>
    </ul>
<b>Important Notes:</b>
    <ol>
    <li>The internship offer letter must include your specific dates of employment.  For example, if you are working for the duration of the Fall 2019 semester, the dates you are eligible to work between are 8/26/2019 and 12/20/2019.</li>
    <li>CPT authorization coincides with the semester dates.  Employment cannot begin until the first day of the semester (usually around January 20th), therefore, there will be a 4 week period of time (approximately) that you cannot work in between semesters.</li>
    <li>You should discuss CPT with Rousseau, Christine <Christine.Rousseau@unh.edu></li>
    </ol>
For the semester if it becomes an option.  Federal regulations limit the amount of CPT a student can use during their degree program in order to still be eligible for post-completion OPT.
</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>10. What are the steps to request CPT Authorization?</b></summary>
<p>
A. To request CPT Authorization, please follow these steps:
<ul>
<li>Meet with the Internship Advisor Professor Karen Jin <karen.jin@unh.edu> prior to submitting the OISS eForm.</li>
<li>Login to <a href="https://www.unh.edu/global/eoiss-online-services">eOISS</a></li>
<li>Under F-1 Practical Training, choose “CPT Authorization Form”.</li>
<li>Complete the form and upload a letter from your employer describing your job title, responsibilities, place of employment, start/end dates and the number of hours you will work per week.</li>
<li>Upload proof of registration for the internship class (a screen print of your registration will suffice).
After you submit the eForm, the Internship Advisor will receive an automated email from OISS requesting their approval for your CPT.</li>
<li>Once the Internship Advisor has approved your request, OISS will issue your new I-20.</li>
<li>An OISS Advisor must issue your I-20 before you can begin employment.  Please submit the eForm and supporting documentation 7-10 days in advance of your start date.</li>
</ul>
